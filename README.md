This repository will have the example for every OOP concepts and will adhere to clean code. I will also try to develop the examples to the extent that I can include various design stratigies and different frameworks. If possible I will try to add the videos. All examples will follow below practices:

## Practices
- Add the upcoming example in Automated-Kanban TO DO.
- Create Issue regarding the item in TO DO and assign that to the contributor.
- Put the idea behind the example and how it will relate to other examples.
- After approving the idea from the reviewer, create a wiki page associated with it.
- Create the LLD Low Level Design Document in Markdown and take the approval from the contributor.
- Develope the code and put pull request for review and merge.
- After passing the pipeline and getting approval form the reviewer the code will get merge.

## CI/CD
- Starting with very simple CI/CD pipeline we will move ahead.

##TEST CASES
- unittest
